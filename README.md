## Insight



**Health and Wellbeing Report - Power BI Dashboard**  
This project is a comprehensive Health and Wellbeing Report designed to analyze and visualize key health metrics, providing actionable insights for individuals and organizations. Built using Microsoft Power BI, the dashboard features interactive visualizations, advanced DAX calculations, and a user-friendly interface to explore trends and patterns in health data.  

The report includes metrics such as BMI, physical activity levels, sleep patterns, calorie intake, and mental wellbeing scores. Visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps highlight correlations, trends, and outliers, enabling data-driven decision-making. For example, the dashboard identifies relationships between physical activity and mental health, tracks progress over time, and provides personalized recommendations for improving overall wellbeing.  

This project demonstrates my expertise in data analysis, data modeling, and dashboard design. I utilized Power BIâ€™s capabilities to clean, transform, and model raw data into meaningful insights. The report is designed to cater to a wide audience, including healthcare professionals, fitness enthusiasts, and organizations focused on employee wellness.  

Key features of the project include:  
- Interactive filters for dynamic data exploration.  
- Advanced DAX formulas for calculating KPIs and metrics.  
- A clean and intuitive design for seamless user experience.  

This project reflects my passion for leveraging data to improve health outcomes and promote wellbeing. I am open to feedback, collaboration, and further enhancements to make this tool even more impactful. Feel free to explore the report and connect with me for discussions or opportunities in data analytics and health tech!
